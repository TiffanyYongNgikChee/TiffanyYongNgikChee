## Featured Projects

### Homomorphic Encryption Benchmark Framework
[grpc-he-benchmark](https://github.com/TiffanyYongNgikChee/grpc-he-benchmark) - A benchmark framework for evaluating the performance of homomorphic encryption libraries in distributed systems. Built with Rust, Docker, and gRPC to measure encryption performance and network overhead in privacy-preserving computation scenarios.

### Text Simplification System
[TextSimplifier](https://github.com/TiffanyYongNgikChee/TextSimplifier) - Command-line Java application that simplifies complex English sentences using word embeddings and cosine similarity. Implements semantic analysis to replace difficult words with simpler alternatives from Google's top 1000 common words list while preserving meaning. Utilizes Java virtual threads for efficient execution.

### Mobile Car Rental Application
[share-my-car](https://github.com/TiffanyYongNgikChee/share-my-car) - Mobile app built with Ionic and Angular featuring real-time location tracking with Google Maps, Firebase authentication, and real-time chat. Supports car listings, bookings, and user profile management with responsive UI design.
